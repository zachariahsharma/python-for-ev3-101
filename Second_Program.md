# The Dog Goes,"Bark"

## The Sound Block

In this chapter we'll talk about sound block. But before we talk about that we need to understand the importance of sound blocks. They are important because when you program, there will be times when you make a mistake and you can't figure out where it is. To solve this problem you can put a sound block in different places of your program so that when you run it you know where th problem is, this is called "Troubleshooting." Now lets creat a new project called ***The dog goes,"Bark."*** This project will be about how to use sound on the EV3. Once you have created your project input this in.
```python
brick.sound.file(SoundFile.DOG_BARK_1)
```
This is a sund block. The *"brick.sound.file"* is pretty easy to understand, its telling python that whatever you put in the parentheses will be a sound file. The sound file starts with very suprisingly *"SoundFile"* You might be wondering *Why did they put that SoundFile in front of the name of the sound file are they just trying to waste our time with it?* Well actually its to make it easier for them, basically when they create all the stuff for the brick, it will be really complex for them if they just put the name of the sound file. If they didn't then they will have a bunch of files that aren't catagorized. We will use sound files a lot in later chapters.
