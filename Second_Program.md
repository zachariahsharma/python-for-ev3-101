# The Dog Goes,"Bark"

## The Sound Block

In this chapter we'll talk about sound functions. Lets start by creating a new project called ***The dog goes,"Bark."*** Once you do that input this into the main file:
```python
brick.sound.file(SoundFile.DOG_BARK_1)
```
What in the world is this?? This is a sound block, but there are many kinds of sound blocks. This sound block is a type of sound block that allows you to make a sound that is a file. Since we are making a dog bark sound we don't have to find our own sound file, it would just be easier to exploit all of the sound files that LEGO has already provided for us. We are only using the dog bark but there are so many different sound files that are already there. You might be thinking *Why are sound blocks important?* they are SUPER important for troubleshooting which means that when you are writing your code and you run it and suddenly there is a problem. One way to solve this is to read your coments and to see if theey are accurate to the code, but sometimes the comments are inaccurate or your problem is a syntax error that is actually not on the line that it says(and yes that happens). Well what you can do is sporadically put a sound block at some places to see where the problem is. In general the sound block is very important and they are really not hard to use.
