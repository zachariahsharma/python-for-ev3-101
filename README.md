 
# Micropython From "Scratch"
 
## Why am I doing this?
 
Hi my name is Zach. I am participating in a competition called FLL. This is a robotics competition in which we build a robot and use it to solve different problems called missions. In the 2019-2020 Competition we programmed missions using a language called labview, unfortunately it was updated and switched to Scratch which is a programming language that none of us were familiar with. My team and I were faced with 2 choices:
 
- Switching to Scratch
- Switching to Micropython
 
Most of us were not as advanced in programming, so we were probably going to switch to Scratch. But this was a hard decision. Although Micropython is a very powerful language, it is very difficult to learn. Since it was new there were no books on it, only the forums. Micro Pythons forum made it very difficult to learn. I was able to learn it, but it was really difficult. As I was trying to learn it I thought to myself "how many of the other teams were faced with the same issue" and I started thinking about different ways I could help. After I started thinking, I thought about how different FLL teams of the future might already know Scratch and want to switch to the more powerful language called Micropython, so that is what I am going to do. I have been learning python for at least 5 years, so when I wanted to learn Micropython I thought it would be a breeze. It wasn't. It was very difficult because the forums didn't make any sense and they didn't have many examples. I don't want anyone else to have to face the hardships of the forums, I want them to have an easy way to transition from Scratch to Micropython.
 
## Introduction
 
I will use 25 programs to help someone to transition to Micropython. I will include functions that you would use in a program that will help you succeed in FLL, one of the main issues in FLL is consistency and that is what these programs will help you with. I will start with very easy things like displaying"Hello World" on the robot screen to using very complex gyro turns so that your turns are completely exact.
