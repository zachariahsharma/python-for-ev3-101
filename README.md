# Micropython From "Scratch"

## Why am I doing this?

Hi my name is Zach. I am participating in a competition called FLL which is a robotics competition where we build a robot and have it solve missions. We used to do the missions using a language called labview but then it was updatedd and switched to scratch. We had 2 choises:

- Switching to Scratch
- Switching to Micropython

Some of us were not as advanced in programming so we are probably going to switch to Scratch. But this was a hard decision, Micropython is a very powerful language but it was very difficult to learn. Since it was new there were no books on it, only the forums. Those forums though make it verydifficult to learn from. So I thought hof how many other teams had this very problem and decided to help. But I thought in the future there will be many teams that already know Scratch and want to switch to the more powerful language called Micropython, so I am going to help out those people to learn it. I have been learning python for at least 5 years so when I wanted to learn Micropython I thought it would be a breeze. It wasn't it was very difficult becuase the forums weren't very specific. I don't want anyone else to have to face the hardships of the forums, I want to make a easy way to transition from Scratch to Micropython.

## Introduction

I will use 25 programs to help someone to transition to Micropython. I will include functions that you would use in program that will help you succeed in FLL, one of the main issues in FLL is consistency and that is what these programs will help you with. I will start with very easy things like displaying,"Hello World" on the robots screen to using, very complex gyro turns so that you turns are completely exact.
