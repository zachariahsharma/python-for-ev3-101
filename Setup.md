Once you place it in there than you turn on the brick and after a few minutes  Micropython opens up. Then use the EV3 Wire and use it to connect your EV3 to your computer.

Go to Visual Studio Code and at the left most side there will be a tab called the explorer tab. When go there then at the bottom there will be at a dropdown called the "EV3DEV Device Browser." Under that there it will say "Click here to connect to a device" Click this and it will ask you which robot you want to pick, although there will be one robot there and a button that says,"I don't see my device..." Click your EV3 and wait under the device browser wait for it to turn green signalling that your robot is ready.

**Hurray YOU have set up your EV3 for Micropython!**
